## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During the development of this challenge I learned how to identify which element is causing a scrollable overflow by interpreting the "scrol" and "overflow" badges that are built in the developer tools.

I got a better understanding of flex-shrink and the way width affects flex-items when I made the two columns of the card component.

### Continued development

In the future I would like to come back to this challenge and use grid instead of flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [The `<s>` element](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_s.asp) - This element helped me show that the price of the product have been lowered. I could've used the line-through value for the text-decoration property using CSS but I think that the `<s>` element is more appropriate.
- [The `<picture>` element](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images_picture.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand how to change an image based on the viewport width. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
